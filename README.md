# Analysis On student aid distrubtion within NYC

[To summarize, i took data pertaining to the distrubtion of student aid. This distrubtion spans from bourough, Esimated Aid amount, what the funds went towords ]

## Methodology

[I used alot of methods i learned from TKH and packges]
-Pandas, Matplotlib, Stackoverflow, Notes, GITHUB, Jupyter Notebook

## Visualizations
output3.png ------  5 most requested services among all 5Bouroughs
3.png ---borough provided with most funding (Amount Total " sed Estimate")
4.png ---------borough with the most requests for funding
output.png --- SED approved estimate distrubtion
output2.png ----- shows the distrubtion of the top 5 projects and how much each borough    need funding towards them.


## Findings

I discovered,I have discovered that the majority of the funding projects descriptions for applications for state aid data . We’re for projects for “ science lab upgrade”, “computer room upgrade”, “asbestos/ abatement” lastly,” remodeling of the student toilets”. These were the four most common requests for state aid among all the five boroughs. Staten Island has beat the Bronx by a little bit over a few thousand dollars in terms of most estimated state funding for projects. While the boroughs with the highest requests for state funding are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, and lastly Manhattan.

One finding that I found very interesting was that in the (4.png) for requests for state funding, Bronx was in first place.Brooklyn was in second on (4.png)  when you look at the (3.png) for received state funds, Brooklyn is not only in fourth, but they have a lower amount nearing $300,000. 

Another interesting finding i found doing anaylsis is that the Bronx needed almost $300,000 in funding towards auditorum upgrades while Staten Island needed about $200,000 towards their toliet upgrades. it seems as though alot of the shared spaces were students used alot (bathrooms) or where it hold large capcity (auditorums) required more funding and upgrades due these spaces being used by majortiy of the student body. While in terms of classroom upgrades I believe the increase of funding comes from the need to accomadate the push of the education policy or curriculum; 'Stem' (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) for inner city students.The upgrades provide better educational exprience for inner city students. 

Asbestos/ Abatement is an overall maintence so i dont find anything too interesting about it because alot of infrustrature is older so asbestos/ abatement is due just for the overall safety for staff and students.

## Next Steps

[Running more anylsis on the data and coming up with different questions]

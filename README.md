3.png ---borough provided with most funding (Amount Total " sed Estimate")
4.png ---------borough with the most requests for funding

## Findings

[I discovered,I have discovered that the majority of the funding projects descriptions for applications for state aid data . We’re for projects for “ science lab upgrade”, “computer room upgrade”, “asbestos/ abatement” lastly,” remodeling of the student toilets”. These were the four most common requests for state aid among all the five boroughs. Staten Island has beat the Bronx by a little bit over a few thousand dollars in terms of most estimated state funding for projects. While the boroughs with the highest requests for state funding are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens and Manhattan.
 One finding that I found very interesting was that in the (4.png) for requests for state funding, Bronx was in first place.Brooklyn was in second on (4.png)  when you look at the (3.png) for received state funds, Brooklyn is not only in fourth, but they have a lower percentage nearing $300,000. ]

## Next Steps

[Running more anylsis on the data and coming up with different questions]
